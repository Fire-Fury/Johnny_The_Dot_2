Johnny The Dot 2 is a second version of the original JTD game.  It will be a platformer with a couple levels.

When trying this project out on your own, be sure to run index.html through a web server.  I have WAMP and I find that it works great running this game.  Another option you may choose is to download Brackets by Adobe and opening the folder where all these files download to.  In that case, all you have to do is press the "live preview" button and Brackets will open index.html in a web server automatically for you.
